This directory contains several demo applications to showcase some of 
the capabilities of FlexGanttFX. Each demo can be started by double clicking
on the file. If this does not work go to the command line and start the
application via the following command:

	java -jar sampler-demo.jar
	
Please make sure to use Java 8.

-- emirates-demo.jar

	This demo is a proof of concept for Emirates airlines. Here it was
	important that FlexGanttFX is capable of displaying a lot of data and
	still allow for smooth scrolling operations. The data files include
	flights during a two year time period.
	
-- msproject-demo.jar

	This app makes use of the open source framework MPXJ. It is basically
	a project file reader for MSProject. If you do not have a project file
	available for testing then please load the file test.mpp.
	
-- sampler-demo.jar

	This is a sampler application where each sample listed on the left-hand
	side focuses on one or more specific features of FlexGanttFX. It is 
	great for testing the framework but also for getting an idea which 
	features are available. 
	
If you have any questions related to these demos please feel free to submit
a question in the FlexGanttFX forum at http://www.dlsc.com
